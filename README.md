# DispensingUnit

 This is a small part of a bigger project. The device is plastic cards dispenser -Creator CRT 531. The whole project consists of Front end - written in PHP and Back end - written in Java. Front end and back are connected to each other through RabbitMQ. Through RabbitMQ messages are sent in JSON format. Java is responsible for work with such devices like bill acceptor, coin acceptor, dispenser, printer, fingerprints scanner, passports scanner. In the whole project I realized more than 10 devices.
